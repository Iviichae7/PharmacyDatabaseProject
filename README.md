- Open your RDBMS and create a new database.
- Copy and paste the SQL script into the query editor.
- Run the script to create the tables and establish the relationships between the tables.

# Viewing the ERD Diagram
To view the ERD diagram.
- Open the image file in an image viewer or diagramming tool.
- Alternatively, you can import the diagram into a software tool that supports ERD modeling, such as StarUML.
