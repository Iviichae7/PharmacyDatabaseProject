<h1 align="center">Pharmacy Database</h1>

### Overview

###### This report outlines the design, implementation, and administration of a comprehensive pharmacy database management system, aimed at effectively managing data related to suppliers, medications, customers, staff, prescriptions, purchases, and activity logs. The development environment used for this project is MySQL Workbench. The system is equipped with advanced SQL programming to provide value-added reporting and insights. The project was developed and maintained using GitHub for version control and collaboration among team members. 

### Introduction

###### In the fast-paced and highly regulated pharmaceutical industry, effective data management is essential for maintaining accuracy, compliance, and profitability. A pharmacy database management system is an invaluable tool for pharmacists, enabling them to track inventory, sales, and customer records with ease. By leveraging the latest technologies and best practices in database design, a well-structured pharmacy database management system can streamline workflows, reduce errors, and improve patient care. The aim of this project is to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly pharmacy database management system that can meet the diverse needs of pharmacists and pharmacy owners. Whether it's tracking prescription orders, storing customer records, or allowing access to supplier information, this system will provide a comprehensive solution to optimize operations and drive success. 

### ERD Diagram Development Process

###### The development of the ERD diagram for our pharmacy database management system involved a collaborative approach to ensure a simple yet effective design.

###### Below is a summary of the steps we took as a team to create the ERD diagram:

1. **Idea Generation:** *Before our scheduled meeting, each team member conducted research and brainstormed ideas for the tables and relationships they wanted to include in the database design.*

2. **Team Meeting:** *During our meeting, we discussed the ideas each team member had gathered and collectively decided on the six initial tables and their relationships for the database.*

3. **ERD Diagram Creation:** *One team member was appointed to create the ERD diagram, while the other members provided input and assistance via group chat.*

4. **Modifications:** *After the initial ERD diagram was completed, the team reviewed the design and made minor changes to data types and relationships to refine the model.*

5. **Addition:** *The team decided to include a 7th table, named Activity_Log, to track staff activity and enhance the database's security features.*

###### By following this collaborative process, we successfully designed an ERD diagram that captures the necessary entities, relationships, and attributes for our pharmacy database management system. The addition of the Activity_Log table provides an extra layer of security, ensuring that the database meets the organization's requirements for data management and security.

### ERD Progress

The ERD defines relationships between the entities with cardinality and participation constraints. Primary keys and foreign keys are outlined to ensure data integrity and referential integrity.

Implementation

The database was implemented using MySQL Workbench, creating tables based on the entities identified in the ERD. Each table includes primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity. Proper naming conventions and adherence to database normalization rules were ensured throughout the implementation process.

Queries

Our team provided a total of 12 complex queries using WHERE, GROUP BY, and JOIN clauses. Each team member contributed four queries, and these queries provided valuable insights and information for the organization's current and future needs.


To use the database, users must have access to MySQL Workbench or a compatible database management tool. The SQL queries provided can be executed to retrieve relevant information as needed. The database schema can be modified and extended to cater to the organization's evolving requirements.

Collaboration and Version Control
Our team utilized GitHub for version control and collaboration throughout the project's development. Each team member committed their work to a shared repository, allowing for seamless collaboration and tracking of changes made to the database and associated files. This approach ensured that the project maintained a consistent history of modifications and provided a platform for addressing any potential issues efficiently.

### The team working on the pharmacy database project for college has made significant contributions in various areas. Cian O'Connor has been instrumental in creating high-level models and implementing the supplier and medication modules. Additionally, he has taken on the shared responsibility of writing half the report and addressing queries 1-4. Michal Babik has been actively involved in creating high-level models and creating an ERD diagram. He has also played a crucial role in the physical implementation of staff, activity log table, and purchase tables. Michal took the other half of the report writing. Furthermore, he has taken on the responsibility of addressing queries 5-8. John Ward has made valuable contributions in creating an ERD diagram, writing proposals, and implementing the prescription and customer tables. He has also taken on the responsibility of addressing queries 9-12. The team's combined efforts have resulted in a well-organized and efficient pharmacy database that meets the project requirements.

### Conclusion

###### From the beginning, the team worked together to determine the objectives of this project, determine project scope, and set a timelines for completion. Each member of the team brought their own vision and skillset to the project, which allowed for a comprehensive and well-rounded approach to database development. As this was a first for us, each member was willing to accept ideas and work together with ease. Collaboration was key during the design and development phase, as the team members worked together to identify user requirements, design the database schema. Regular communication and feedback loops were established throughout the project to ensure that all team members were aligned and working towards the same objectives. Some of the main tools of communication included Github, Microsoft Teams and Whatsapp. Through effective collaboration, the team was able to successfully complete the project on time and to a high standard, resulting in a robust and user-friendly pharmacy database management system.

###### In conclusion, the pharmacy database management system developed for this project offers a powerful solution to the data management challenges facing pharmacists and pharmacy owners today. By providing a centralized and streamlined system for tracking inventory, sales, and customer records, this database can help pharmacies save time, reduce errors, and improve patient care. The system is designed with best practices in database design and is capable of meeting the complex needs of the pharmaceutical industry. Our aim was to give pharmacists a system  which provides a comprehensive data management solution that can help pharmacies optimize operations and achieve their business goals. We are confident that this database will make a significant impact on the work life of its users, and we look forward to seeing its benefits in action.
